You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the `drp` table. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:
  
  1. Show data for OCHCO, descending order by years of service federal.
  2. What are the most common job roles or occupational series?
  3. Is there a correlation between years of service and grade level?
  4. How does retirement eligibility impact workforce planning?
  
  You can also say "Reset" to clear the current filter/sort, or "Help" for more usage tips.
